A personal project to learn basics of Game Engine Development.
Sphynx Engine is a prototype of a game engine/framework with tools (still work in progress).

Build system is Premake. 
Run gen.bat if you are on windows to generate project files and build Sandbox of an executable.
The Sphynx project is the framework
